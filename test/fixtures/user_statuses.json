It'll help them out. Big shoutout to Batgirl12309, KrewLee47 and Nanohanan.<br /><br />Beware, I may not continue this, as one of my mates are still sort of... \"skeptical\" to say, so if they don't like it, I'll either remove it or replace it with someone else. Already have one other person in mind.<br /><br />Laterz!<br />XxMLRPJordanxX - (Can't wait until I leave school in 6 weeks)",

People can go and copy and paste my drawings anywhere. If they claim that it's there own, when in actuality I originally did it, they will just be digging themselves a deeper grave, because that means that people will be expecting higher hopes from them. And the moment that I lose my account and remove all of my artwork, there going to have to find another source.<br /><br />So yeah, you wanna copy and paste my stuff? Go ahead. Wanna say that you did it? Go ahead. Just remember that you will be expected to do even more greater things for you fans and/or watchers.<br /><br />Great way at looking at it in my opinion. Sounds a bit like an angry rant, but it's just the way I look at it.",

      "body": "WELCOME TO MY PAGE!<br />Welcome ladies and gentleman (or both) to my Deviantart page, my name is XxMLRPJordanxX and I am not much of an artist, however, I do like writing web novels, books and short stories. The only real \"Art-type\" style of work i am uploading is posting images from either my mates, people i watch or from my weavesilk folder that i have on my Laptop.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about what i post, now onto my personal details. I am an Australian who lives in Queensland who does nothing but school work, watch anime, read manga, play games and type up stories. My goal in life is to create movies, shows, games and stories to share with the online community. My current short-term goals are getting a Bachelor in Digital Media and an Associates Degree in Information Technology. Hopefully getting involved into something related to Law.<br /><br />To explain what these two options are, for those who don't know: Digital Media is creating things like animation, games, websites and everything else similar to those. Information Technology is Network Security, Business Analysis and Application Development.<br /><br />So as you all can possibly tell, i am a computer freak, i like using computers, i like pulling them apart, putting them together, but most of all, i like making games, stories, animations and all the productive stuff.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this entire useless paragraph of my future and my inspirations. Remember, don't expect any artistical works from me, unless you are looking for Weavesilk work.<br /><br />BTW, weavesilk is a free online program that can be used by anyone. www.weavesilk.com",
